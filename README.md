*DESCRIPTION* : üìù Task Description:
This task involved the end-to-end process of migrating a relational database system from MySQL (source) to PostgreSQL (target). The objective was to replicate the database structure, transfer data correctly, and ensure that the target database functions identically to the source system.

The process included:

Schema Analysis & Conversion:

Analyzed MySQL schema including tables, primary/foreign keys, data types, and constraints.

Translated MySQL-specific data types and syntax (like AUTO_INCREMENT) into PostgreSQL-compatible equivalents (like SERIAL).

Data Export & Import:

Extracted data from MySQL using SQL INSERT scripts.

Imported the data into PostgreSQL using COPY, INSERT, or direct SQL execution.

Data Integrity Checks:

Verified row counts and key constraints after migration.

Ensured data relationships (foreign keys, null constraints) were preserved.

Issue Resolution:

Addressed compatibility issues such as reserved keywords, function differences, and data type mismatches.

Handled encoding and nullability issues during import.

üíª Tools Used:
OneCompiler.com (SQL) ‚Äì For writing, testing, and running SQL queries in both MySQL and PostgreSQL environments online.

SQL Script Editors ‚Äì Like VS Code and Notepad++ for formatting and editing migration scripts.

Manual Testing & Querying ‚Äì To verify correctness of data after migration.

üì¶ Deliverables:
‚úÖ Migration Scripts:

SQL scripts for creating tables in PostgreSQL.

Data insertion scripts to replicate MySQL data.

‚úÖ Summary Report:

Step-by-step explanation of the migration process.

Challenges faced and solutions applied.
